Instructions : 

 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
 
	1	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
	2	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  
	3	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
	4	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
	5	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



My run_analysis.R file produces two txt files, tidydata.txt and averaged_tidydata.txt. tidydata.txt  is the output of my tidy dataframe after step 4 of the above instructions and averaged_tidydata.txt is the dataset produced from step 5. 

The codebook CodeBook.md file summarises the data and describes any changes to the variable names.
